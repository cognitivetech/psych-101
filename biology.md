## Nervous System
**The Nervous System's Three Functions**
1. Receives sensory input from the world
2. Processes information in the brain
3. Responds to the information by acting on it

**Your Nervous System: Central and Peripheral Divisions**
- The central nervous system (CNS) consists of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
- The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of nerve cells outside of the CNS.
- The two divisions work together to allow you to think, feel, and act.

**Neurons: The Basic Units of Your Nervous System**
- Neurons are the basic units of the human nervous system.
- They receive, integrate, and transmit information in the nervous system.
- Neurons communicate selectively with other neurons to form networks.

**Structure of Neurons**
1. **Dendrites**: short, branchlike extensions that receive signals from neighboring neurons.
2. **Cell body**: collects and integrates incoming information.
3. **Axon**: transmits electrical impulses along its length.
4. **Terminal buttons**: release neurotransmitters into the synapse to communicate with other neurons.

**Neural Communication**
- Neurons communicate through chemical signals called neurotransmitters at the synapse.
- The neurons do not touch each other in the synapse but release chemicals that cross the gap between them.
- This selective communication forms neural networks, allowing complex mental activity and behavior.

## Three Phases of Neural Communication

1. **Transmission Phase:**
   * Electrical signals travel along axons, releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse.
   * Myelin sheath insulates axons for faster neural communication.
2. **Reception Phase:**
   * Dendrites of receiving neurons receive signals from sending neurons.
   * Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.
3. **Integration Phase:**
   * Postsynaptic neuron assesses and integrates incoming signals.
   * Excitatory or inhibitory signals produced, influencing the likelihood of firing an action potential.

**Electrical Properties of Neurons**

* Neurons have a semipermeable membrane that regulates electrical activity.
* Inside and outside of neurons have different electrical charges.
* Stimulation causes sodium ions to enter, creating an action potential.
* Action potential travels down the axon, releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse.
* Sodium-potassium pump returns neuron to resting state after refractory period.

**Action Potentials and Neurotransmission**

* Action potentials allow one neuron to send a message to another neuron.
* Firing frequency depends on stimulation intensity but not strength of action potential.
* Neurons communicate across the synapse through neurotransmitters.

**Neurotransmitter Release and Reuptake**

* Neurotransmitters are released into the synapse upon arrival of an action potential.
* They bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, stimulating a response.
* Neurotransmitters can be removed from the synapse through reuptake or enzyme degradation.

**Excitatory and Inhibitory Signals**

* Postsynaptic neuron processes incoming signals in integration phase.
* Excitatory signals increase likelihood of firing an action potential, while inhibitory signals decrease it.
* Thousands of signals are added together to determine whether the neuron fires or not.

## Neurotransmitter Functions

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that play a crucial role in communication between nerve cells, or neurons, in the nervous system. They transmit signals across synapses, the gaps between neurons, allowing for the transmission of signals from one cell to another. Here are some key neurotransmitters and their functions:

1. **Acetylcholine (ACh):**
   - **Function:** Involved in muscle contraction, learning, and memory.
   - **Location:** Found in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
2. **Dopamine:**
   - **Function:** Regulates mood, reward, and pleasure; involved in motor control and learning.
   - **Implications:** Imbalances linked to disorders like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
3. **Serotonin:**
   - **Function:** Regulates mood, appetite, and sleep; contributes to feelings of well-being.
   - **Implications:** Linked to mood disorders, including depression and anxiety.
4. **Norepinephrine (NE) / Noradrenaline:**
   - **Function:** Involved in arousal, alertness, and stress response; regulates mood.
   - **Implications:** Imbalances associated with mood disorders, such as depression.
5. **Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA):**
   - **Function:** Main inhibitory neurotransmitter; regulates anxiety and stress.
   - **Implications:** Low GABA levels associated with anxiety disorders.
6. **Glutamate:**
   - **Function:** Main excitatory neurotransmitter; crucial for learning and memory.
   - **Implications:** Excessive glutamate linked to neurodegenerative diseases.
7. **Endorphins:**
   - **Function:** Act as natural painkillers; contribute to feelings of pleasure and euphoria.
   - **Implications:** Released during exercise and stress, promoting a sense of well-being.
8. **Histamine:**
   - **Function:** Involved in allergic responses; regulates sleep-wake cycles.
   - **Implications:** Antihistamines are used to manage allergies and promote sleep.
9. **Oxytocin:**
   - **Function:** Regulates social bonding, trust, and love; important in childbirth and breastfeeding.
   - **Implications:** Known as the "love hormone" or "bonding hormone."
10. **Adenosine:**
    - **Function:** Promotes sleep and relaxation; inhibited by caffeine.
    - **Implications:** Linked to sleep-wake cycles and alertness.

## Drugs and Neurotransmitters
Drugs can impact neurotransmitters by acting as agonists or antagonists. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses, the junctions between nerve cells. Here's how drugs can influence neurotransmitters:

1. **Agonists:**
   - **Definition:** Agonists are substances that enhance or mimic the effects of neurotransmitters.
   - **Mechanism:** Agonist drugs can bind to and activate neurotransmitter receptors, leading to an increase in neurotransmission.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Opioids:** Opioid drugs, such as morphine or oxycodone, act as agonists for endorphin receptors, producing pain relief and euphoria.
     - **Benzodiazepines:** Drugs like diazepam (Valium) act on GABA receptors, enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA neurotransmission, resulting in sedation and reduced anxiety.

2. **Antagonists:**
   - **Definition:** Antagonists are substances that inhibit or block the effects of neurotransmitters.
   - **Mechanism:** Antagonist drugs can bind to neurotransmitter receptors without activating them, preventing the natural neurotransmitter from binding and exerting its effects.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Antipsychotics:** Drugs like haloperidol act as antagonists for dopamine receptors, reducing the effects of excess dopamine and helping manage symptoms of psychosis.
     - **Beta-blockers:** Medications such as propranolol act as antagonists for adrenaline (epinephrine) receptors, mitigating the effects of the fight-or-flight response.

3. **Reuptake Inhibitors:**
   - **Definition:** Some drugs block the reuptake of neurotransmitters, preventing their removal from the synaptic cleft and prolonging their presence.
   - **Mechanism:** By inhibiting reuptake, more neurotransmitters remain in the synapse, intensifying their impact on the postsynaptic neuron.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** Drugs like fluoxetine (Prozac) inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, leading to increased serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft and improved mood in conditions like depression.

4. **Enzyme Inhibitors:**
   - **Definition:** Some drugs can inhibit enzymes responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters.
   - **Mechanism:** By inhibiting degradation, these drugs increase the concentration of neurotransmitters in the synapse.
   - **Example:**
     - **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):** MAOIs prevent the breakdown of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, increasing their availability and treating conditions like depression.

     - **Learning New Skills:** Allows the brain to acquire new skills and adapt to changing demands.
     - **Compensation:** Enables compensation for sensory deficits through enhanced processing in remaining modalities.
4. **Neural Pruning:** 
   - During neural development, overabundant connections form among neurons. Subsequently, life experiences help "prune" some of these connections to strengthen the rest, making the brain more efficient. This process occurs mainly during childhood.
