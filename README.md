## Biology

1. **Nervous System:**
   - **Central Nervous System (CNS):**
     - *Brain:* The command center of the nervous system, responsible for processing information, initiating actions, and regulating bodily functions. It consists of various regions with specialized functions, such as the frontal lobe for executive functions and the hippocampus for memory.
     - *Spinal Cord:* Connects the brain to the peripheral nervous system and facilitates the transmission of signals between the brain and the rest of the body.
   - **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):**
     - *Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):* Regulates involuntary bodily functions, including heartbeat, digestion, and respiratory rate. Divided into the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches.
     - *Somatic Nervous System:* Controls voluntary muscle movements and transmits sensory information to the CNS.
2. **Brain Structure and Function:**
   - **Different Brain Regions:**
     - *Frontal Lobe:* Involved in decision-making, problem-solving, and social behavior. Contains the prefrontal cortex, crucial for executive functions.
     - *Temporal Lobe:* Associated with auditory processing and memory formation. Includes the hippocampus.
     - *Parietal Lobe:* Processes sensory information and spatial awareness.
     - *Occipital Lobe:* Responsible for visual processing.
     - *Limbic System:* Includes the amygdala (emotion) and hippocampus (memory).
     - *Basal Ganglia:* Involved in motor control and procedural learning.
   - **Neurotransmitters:**
     - *Serotonin:* Regulates mood, appetite, and sleep.
     - *Dopamine:* Influences motivation, reward, and pleasure.
     - *Norepinephrine:* Affects alertness and arousal.
3. **Endocrine System:**
   - **Hormones:**
     - *Released by Glands:* Various glands, such as the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, release hormones into the bloodstream.
     - *Impact on Psychology:* Hormones influence mood, stress response, growth, metabolism, and reproductive processes.
   - **Pituitary Gland:**
     - *Master Gland:* Regulates other endocrine glands.
     - *Growth Hormone:* Stimulates growth and development.
4. **Genetics and Environmental Influences:**
   - **Genetics:**

   - **Nature vs. Nurture:**
     - *Interaction:* Both genetic predispositions and environmental experiences contribute to psychological development.
     - *Critical Periods:* Sensitive periods in development where environmental influences have a profound impact.

## Behavior

1. **Classical Conditioning:**
   - **Definition:** Classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an involuntary response through repeated pairing with a stimulus that naturally evokes the response.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - *Unconditioned Stimulus (US):* A stimulus that naturally triggers an involuntary response.
     - *Unconditioned Response (UR):* The involuntary response to the unconditioned stimulus.
     - *Conditioned Stimulus (CS):* Initially a neutral stimulus, it becomes associated with the unconditioned stimulus.
     - *Conditioned Response (CR):* The learned response to the conditioned stimulus.
   - **Example:** In Pavlov's classic experiment, a dog learns to associate the sound of a bell (CS) with the presentation of food (US). Over time, the bell alone can elicit salivation (CR), even without the presence of food.
2. **Operant Conditioning:**
   - **Definition:** Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of one's actions. Behavior is strengthened or weakened based on the positive or negative consequences it produces.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - *Reinforcement:* Increases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again.
       - *Positive Reinforcement:* Adding a positive stimulus to encourage a behavior.
       - *Negative Reinforcement:* Removing an aversive stimulus to encourage a behavior.
     - *Punishment:* Decreases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again.
       - *Positive Punishment:* Adding an aversive stimulus.
       - *Negative Punishment:* Removing a positive stimulus.
   - **Example:** If a student is praised (positive reinforcement) for completing homework, the likelihood of them completing future assignments may increase. Conversely, if they lose a privilege (negative punishment) for not completing homework, the behavior might decrease.
3. **Learning by Watching Others (Observational Learning):**
   - **Definition:** Observational learning involves acquiring new behaviors or information by watching and imitating others.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - *Modeling:* Individuals observe the behavior of a model and imitate it.
     - *Vicarious Reinforcement/Punishment:* Observers learn from the consequences experienced by the model.
   - **Example:** A child learning to tie their shoes by watching a parent or a student adopting study habits by observing classmates can be instances of observational learning. Bandura's famous Bobo doll experiment demonstrated how children imitated aggressive behavior modeled by adults.

## Development
